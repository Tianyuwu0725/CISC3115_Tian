13.1
b) is a legal abstract class because it is declared as abstract and it has an abstract method

13.3
because numberRef is integer object, the (Double) is try to make numberRef to integer, it type cast error

13.5
it throw out the ArrayStoreException, because it wants to change the integer array to "double" element

13.6
3
3.0

13.7
The method compareTo(Integer) is undefined for the type Number

13.8
the method already return as int value, so the (Integer) is unneccesary

13.13
no. can't use the new in instance of an interface
13.14
yes

13.15
interface A { void print(); } is the correct one. it has interface named A and method print();

13.16
when you implements the class you should use public before the void, for eample public void m1()

13.17
True. if the class implements are comparable, means the class can be compared to other

13.18
public int compareTo(String o) this allow to compare string with other string object

13.19
no. because object does not have compareTo method

13.20
more easy to sort and easy to uesd in collection

13.21
person class need to implement to comparable interface

13.22
if the object does not implement the java.lang.Cloneable. you can't invoke the clone()

13.23

13.24
it will print out the current time. and it will be true

13.25
true
false
list is [New York, Atlanta]
list1 is [New York, Atlanta]
list2.get(0) New York
list2.size() is 2

13.26
clone method return object, not GeometricObject

13.29
A.False
B.True
C.True
D.False
F.False
